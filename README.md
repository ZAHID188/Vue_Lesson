Before begin our journey we must check npm is installed or not in our pc.
I mean , we have to be sure that nodejs is installed and it's set in the environment variable.


Then, I need to install Vue using

npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
# OR
Check version
vue --version


Then 
vue -ui for creating project 

or we can manually create project
 vue create [projectname] -- all lower case.
